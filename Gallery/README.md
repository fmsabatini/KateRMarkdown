Here's a gallery of RMarkdown reports produced by the participants of the 2021 Course.

Each participant was asked to choose a cute, wild species of cat and produce an RMarkdown project 
reporting some fun facts about the chosen species, including an image of the cat, showing some data in a table,
and creating a graph based on the data.
